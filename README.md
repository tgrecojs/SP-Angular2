**Angular 2.0 Component - TypeScript**
This branch contains code for a tutorial on creating re-usable components in Angular 2.0 using TypeScript. Please note that this component **must be runing on a server** in order for these examples to work. If these examples are not loaded on a browser, then [System.js](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) will fail to load our code.
